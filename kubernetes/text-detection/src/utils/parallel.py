    """Implements data parallelism at the module level.

    This container parallelizes the application of the given module by
    splitting the input across the specified devices by chunking in the
    batch dimension.
    In the forward pass, the module is replicated on each device,
    and each replica handles a portion of the input. During the backwards pass,
    gradients from each replica are summed into the original module.
    Note that the outputs are not gathered, please use compatible
    :class:`encoding.parallel.DataParallelCriterion`.

    The batch size should be larger than the number of GPUs used. It should
    also be an integer multiple of the number of GPUs so that each chunk is
    the same size (so that each GPU processes the same number of samples).

    Args:
        module: module to be parallelized
        device_ids: CUDA devices (default: all devices)
