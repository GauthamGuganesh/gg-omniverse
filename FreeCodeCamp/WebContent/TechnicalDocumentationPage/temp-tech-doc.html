				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.			</p>
				
				<p>
JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.
				</p>

				<header>Data types</header>
				<p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean</li>
					<li>null</li>
					<li>undefined</li>
					<li>Number</li>
					<li>String</li>
					<li>Symbol</li>
					<li>Object</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

				<p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
				<code>With the keyword var. For example,
						var x = 42.	</code>
				<code>By simply assigning it a value. For example,
						x = 42.</code>
				<code>With the keyword let. For example,
 						let y = 13.</code>
				<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
				<header>Variable scope</header>
				<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. </p>
				<p> For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
				<code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
				<code> This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
defined</code>
			<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. </p>

			<section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
				<header>Global variables</header>
				<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax. </p>
				<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber</p>
