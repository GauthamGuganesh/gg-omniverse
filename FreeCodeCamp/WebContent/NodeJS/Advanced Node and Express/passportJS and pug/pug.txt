  head
    title= pageTitle
    script(type='text/javascript').

        p You are amazing

      p.
        Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a
        strong focus on performance and powerful features.
      
  *In your Pug file, you're able to use a variable by referencing the variable name as #{variable_name} inline with other text 
   on an element or by using an equal sign on the element without a space such as p=variable_name 
   which assigns the variable's value to the p element's text.
   
         if showLogin
         	h1 Enter username-password 
         else 
         	h1 Hello-World . => showLogin is a variable. Fed when rendering pug file in res.render({showLogin: true});
   
   Eg: h1 Hello #{user} you are using pug. => inline example
       h1=user => assigning variable to text of a tag.
