WHY FACTORY ?

  When object creation logic becomes complex(many constructors with different set of arguments- OVERLOADING HELL)
  or there are lot of classes whose objects are to be created and the logic is turning convoluted.
  
  Contructors are not so descriptive. Are limited by their name having to be the classname. 
  Factory methods can be more descriptive. (MAIN reason for factory design pattern)
  
  Overloading just on names of contructors not possible.
  
  IMP : Only for WHOLE-SALE creation of objects. Not piece-wise like with builders.
  
  * Have a descriptive factory method inside the object for creation.
  * Make the constructor PRIVATE forcing the user to use the factory method.
  * Hierarchy of objects can have a corresponding hierarchy of factories. >>AbstractFactory
