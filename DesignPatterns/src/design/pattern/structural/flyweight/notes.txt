FLYWEIGHT:
   A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing common data associated with objects externally 

   In Flyweight pattern we use a HashMap that stores reference to the object which have already been created,
   every object is associated with a key. Now when a client wants to create an object, 
   he simply has to pass a key associated with it and 
   if the object has already been created we simply get the reference to that object else it creates a new object and 
   then returns it reference to the client.
   
   Intrinsic - properties common to all objects 
   Extrinsic - properties specific to objects
