ADAPTER:
   A software construct that adapts an existing interface, say X, to conform to a particular interface Y.
   
   
   The adapter pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
Example: 
   You have access to an interface which returns a list of lines. But you need points in your own implementation,
   LineToPointAdapter does the conversion (or) adapts the existing line interface to conform to points.
   
   Adapter caching done to prevent multiple conversions of a same object.
