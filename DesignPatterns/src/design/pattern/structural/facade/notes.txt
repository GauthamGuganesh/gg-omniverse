FACADE:
  Provides a simple easy to understand user interface/API over a large sophisticated body of code.
  
   Makes an external communication layer over an existing system which is incompatible with the system.
   Facade deals with interfaces, not implementation.
   Its purpose is to hide internal complexity behind a single interface that appears simple on the outside.
