Strategy: System behaviour partially specified at runtime.

    Enables the exact behaviour of a system to be selected. Either at runtime or compiletime.
    
    * Identify high level algorithm - common things.
    * Then design interfaces. - the specific strategies
    
  Eg : TextProcessor. Any text processor has an output. Here if an output strategy is implemented,
  depending on runtime choice of output(markdown or html), we can generate different output for same text input.
  
  Static approach ->  have Type argument(generics) as a strategy-implementor reference.
