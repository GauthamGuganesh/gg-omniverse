Observer -
    A component that desires to be informed of events that occur in a system/object.
    Eg: When an object does some actions, or some event occurs observer would like to be informed about that.
    
    Observable - the component generating the events. 
    	Observable must provide an event or eventAPI to subscribe.
    
 Limitation : If eg: PropertyChangeEvent is fired and several properties are changing. If properties are not dependent on
 each other, it's simple. But if properties are dependent on each other and change with respect to each other, Observer pattern
 becomes quite complicated and we need to track the dependencies.
