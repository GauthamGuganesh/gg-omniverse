COMMAND Design pattern:

An object that represents an instruction to perform particular actions. Contains all information necessary for the action
to be taken.

In java, we cannot preserve a java statement. Eg: int a = 5; b = 4; We cannot undo this. The statement is lost.
Using command object, we can store the set of operations, undo/redo.

Encapsulate all details of an operation into a separate object. => Thus useful information can be serialized, stored in memory/disk.
