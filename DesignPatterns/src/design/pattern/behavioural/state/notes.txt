State :
     A pattern in which the behaviour of an object depends on the state of the object. A state transitions from one state to
     another.
     
     A state machine is a construct that manages state transitions.
     
     Every single state should be an object.TIP:  Use enum if you don't have any particular behaviour for states.
     Every state machine has rules describing state transitions. Triggers triggering transitions.
     
     Map<State, List<Pair<Trigger, State>> - eg of a data structure used in state machine.
     A list of possible transitions for each state and the trigger that transitions it.
     
  Can be done from scratch or using frameworks like statemachine library from Spring.
