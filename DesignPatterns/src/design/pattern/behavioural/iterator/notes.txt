ITERATOR:
   A helper object that facilitates us to traverse a data structure.
   
 Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
 
 Iterator<T> - We need to implement this interface if we are building our own iterator.
 Only Downside - No recursion in iterator<T>.
 
 Iterable<T> - Implementing this means, the implementing object can be put inside a for loop.
