Template Method
  Allows to define skeleton of algorithm in base class, implementations in derived class. 
  Similar to strategy, but uses inheritance.
  
  *Define algorithm at high level
  *Then define constituent parts as abstract methods.
  
Instead of having a refernce of the interface inside the TextProcessor like in strategy,
we make TextProcessor abstract and have abstract methods. If you want HTMLOutput, extend TextProcessor as HTMLTextProcessor and 
implement. The abstract method will be a template, like,

abstract class TextProcessor
{
	public void process() //Template method that details the high level algorithm
	{
	 	start(); //Abstract methods
	 	addItemToListAndRender();
	 	end();
	}
	
	public void abstract start();
	public void abstract addItemToListAndRender();
	public void end();
}

HTMLTextProcessor can extend this and implement.
