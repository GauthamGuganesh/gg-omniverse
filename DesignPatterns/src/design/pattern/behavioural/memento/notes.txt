A token/handle representing a snapshot of the system state. Allows us to roll back to that state.
May or may not expose state information.

Memento - should always be read-only. 

Limitation : 
 * Memory occupcation - This is where Command pattern is better. Because it just lists the changes (less smaller than states).
 * Constructor cannot return a memento.
 
 Memento for interop:
 * Classes in C++ cannot be instantiated in Java. For this interop, we can expose the object in C++ memory using a memento 
 to Java.
